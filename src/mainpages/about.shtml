    About Me
</h2>
<!-- Text and Photos-->
<br>
<p>
    I'm a senior in high school in North Carolina, and besides cooking and baking, I love to code. I started
    making this website in my spare time (so excuse any bugs you find). I've worked with some no-code tools,
    but I really love coding from scratch. So, all of this is from my own mind or from tutorials I found online.
    If you want to reach out, I have my contact info listed on the contact page.

<h2>
    My Cooking Story
</h2>
<br>
<p>
    I haven't been cooking and baking for too long, but these activities have always been important in my family.
    We have annual traditions like cookie decorating, and we love to spend time together in the kitchen. Working
    together to make a meal lets us spend time together and show our love through our culinary traditions, however
    simple or elaborate the dish may be. I hope you enjoy these photos!
